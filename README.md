## Features
This project is a simple Desktop application made in python. The main function is to perform audio steganography with different algorithms
* We use 4 algorithms: LSB 1 bit, LSB k bit(k>=2), parity coding , phase coding.

## Technology
We use Tkinter for gui, python as our main language.
